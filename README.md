## E-commerce
Not a real production application. This project is built with JavaScript at its core. Use of libraries and packages is minimal.
No template language, database is used. HTML wrapped in backquotes(template strings) is used as templating language and database is replaced by saving files on server.
Nodejs core modules are utilised for file reading, password hashing, etc.

There are 2 parts to this app - 
* Public pages - products and cart view
* Private pages - admin login and sign up, products CRUD
